                I am a passionate software engineer. I have strong skills in Python and C, and a growing knowledge of JavaScript. One of my most notable projects is an e-commerce website built using Django and TailwindCSS, which I deployed on DigitalOcean. For media management, I integrated Cloudinary, and I automated deployments using GitHub pipelines. While I do not have much to showcase yet, I am deeply committed to coding and problem-solving, always excited by the potential of building new things.

                Beyond coding, I enjoy traveling and driving long distances, which allows me to clear my mind and find inspiration. I am also focusing on improving my health and fitness, with plans to join a boxing club and a shooting range. My love for learning extends beyond softwareâ€”I&#39;m currently exploring IoT technology, a field I believe holds great promise for future innovation.

                Although I&#39;m relatively new to the world of software development, I am a fast learner, always seeking to expand my knowledge. As I embark on this journey, I&#39;m eager to apply my skills, build more projects, and continue honing my craft in software engineering.
